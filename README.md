# S.S.E.H.C.
## Semi-supervised Scalable Evaluation-perfect Heuristic Chess 
Chess backwards because I couldn't think of a better name

A lot of code lifted from https://github.com/jeromew21/Blobfish

# Goals
Reinforcement learning evaluation tuning

Parallelization + Scalable and high level of optimization (vector optimization, SSE, etc.)

Test engine strength and debug by comparing evaluation against other engines

# Secondary goals
Support for variants

Full UCI support

Portability

# Compiling 

`make`
